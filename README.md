# DevFi

Git to Earn for Devs

## About

Devfi is a platform that allows developers to earn crypto by contributing to open source projects. We believe that open source projects are the backbone of the software industry and that developers should be rewarded for their contributions.

## How it works

Simply add the DevFi bot to your organization or project and deposit some crypto. Any future contributions to issues which the organization have placed bounties on will be paid out once a pull request is merged.

Users simply need to comment in their pull request which issue they are solving and the bot will automatically pay out the bounty.

## How to use

Organizations can add the DevFi bot from the app and then comment in a bounty issue with the amount of crypto they wish to pay out.

Example:
`Bounty 2 SOL`

Users can then comment in the pull request which issue they are solving and the bot will automatically pay out the bounty.

Example:
`Fixes #1`
